# QtExtra
Qt Extra components and widgets

## Introduction
This repository consists of extra components and widgets for popular Qt Framework.

## Supported Qt versions
Currently, minimal required Qt version is Qt 5.1.1, but it's planned to enable support of earlier versions of Qt (but not older than Qt 4.3 or Qt 4.5). 
Thus some components and widgets may or may not work with versions older than Qt 5.

## Documentation

## Widget Gallerey
Here are some examples of widgets that QtExtra provide:
